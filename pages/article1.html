      Taking picture isn’t new, what is new is that now they are public. Instagram is a place where people can share photos and videos. 1 billion people subscribed to it since its creation in 2010 and 500 million people use it every day around the world, posting 95 millions photos and videos a day.Some of the most popular Instagram profiles are the influencers’ profiles. Indeed influencers and especially outdoor influencers share content of natural sites.Along with these posts are geotagging. Geotagging was created in 2012. The concept is to put the position where the photo or the video was taken. This phenomenon has a negative effect on the places geotagged and in expansion on the environment. As a matter of fact, the followers of those influencers have the desire to copy them and recreate the different photos and videos. The idea of mimetism is very present on social media and more particularly on Instagram. People want to reproduce these popular posts to have more likes. So
      they go on natural sites and this creates mass-tourism. A huge amount of people go there, take a photo and leave. For example: Trolltunga in Norway saw its visits explode: going from 800 visitors in 2010 to 80,000 in 2016.
    There is an evolution of tourism in our society nowadays. People are more influenced by what they see on social media than before. The users of Instagram rely on this social media to live. As a matter of fact 49% of the consumers depend on influencers’ recommendations to choose their destination of vacation according to the photos and videos they saw. With Instagram the popularity of tourism has increased. In other words people are used to see photos of vacation places and they are unconsciously influenced to reproduce those posts, so more and more people go on exotic destinations and share their photos and videos. For example in 1995, we counted 500 million international travellers whereas in 2017 they were 1,3 billion. In every sites where tourism increased because of this Instagram phenomenon, the pollution increased as well. This mass tourism that is created by Instagram, influencers and the desire of mimetism has a concrete and dangerous effect on Nature. First this has effects on National Parks. Indeed people can help promote parks. They bring a better visibility and so more incomes to National Parks. But unfortunately they can also impact their ecosystems. In 2018, 318 millions people visit America’s National Parks and this massive crowds coming into those parks can have a disastrous effect on their environments. We are going to use Yosemite National Park to expose our viewpoint. It is  undeniably one of the largest and most popular park of the United States, with 4.160000 visitors of Yosemite in 2018. This huge amount of people in addition to the effects of society and human development as an harmful consequence on Nature and the environment of the park in different ways. To illustrate this idea we are going to talk about John Lemons. He is a professors of biological and environmental sciences and he goes to Yosemite since he is a child. He saw its transformation caused by visitors and the National Park Service. Indeed the park administration encourage its popularity by creating more and more infrastructures for the visitors and tourists. And this has consequences on several aspects, not only on animals’ wildlife that is disturbed due to invasive visitors, to the noise they make, to nearby highways and airports. But also by standing and walking on forbidden grounds that can deteriorate their natural habitats. In addition the park management kill 1 to 5 bears every year because they are considered as a nuisance for the visitors. It as consequences on ecosystems where trees are cut down to enhance the views so that people can take better pictures, they also constricted the rivers to create roads, paved trails, buildings and campsites, that altered the plants and animals species as well. But the most worrying issues is the air and water pollution of the park caused, directly or indirectly, by humans for example with their cars, tour buses and garbage left by visitors.All this new infrastructures made exclusively for the comfort of the tourists are harming the ecosystem of the park just for the profit of the administration.
    We are basically damaging Mother nature for our own little Instagram post. Nature become a product. Visiting the parks is not an experience anymore.
