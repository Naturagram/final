          To illustrate more thoroughly this « replica fever » we are going to study the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve.
      The Antelope Valley California is a state-protected reserve in California, USA. It was created in 1976 with the aim to protect the flowers and their blooming. This 1700 acres park of poppies is visited by thousands of people per year during the blooming season from march to may. But this colorful reserve is in danger due to the number of people who are visiting the park.
      In 2017 the reserve experienced the largest eruption of flowers in more than a decade. They give to this event the name of “Super Bloom”. Massive crowds went to the park at the same time to be able to see this super bloom and to take pictures of it but unfortunately they all started disregarding the rules of the park and trail guides. They walked on the flowers, some of the visitors were laying on them or picking them just to have the most impressive and “instagrammable” pictures to post. The park even had to close just one month after its opening because of the damages made to the poppies because of this massive crowds that didn’t respected the flowers. The trampling of the flowers is a problem that the park administration is really concern about, because after 2017 some areas of the reserve haven’t fully recovered.
      And in 2019 another “Super Bloom” happened. Some influencers went there the first week of the blooming to catch this amazing event and to post it on social media. Therefore there was an outburst of interest and just the next week-end 100,000 people came to see the poppies to have a photo like their favorite  influencers. This amount of visitors created an horrible traffic that polluted the air of the reserve and they were not respecting all the rules put in place by the park administration to prevent the flowers to be damage. For example on a Saturday of the same year 50,000 people went to the park and on the following monday 105,000 Instagram posts used the hashtag #Superbloom. This entirely prove the correlation between the influence of Instagram and the increase of visitors in some places. The ecosystem of this reserve, that was created especially for protecting the flowers, is put in jeopardy by the visitors who just think about their next post on Instagram.
      What happened the last few years demonstrate perfectly how those Instagram posts are costing the lives of the poppies. Indeed the fact that people willingly crush the poppies to take pictures is destroying this environment. Men and women don’t take into account the warnings of the park agents and disrespect the rules put in place to preserve these flowers.

      Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not just happening in Yosemite and the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, it is happening all over the world. For example, the small town of Page, Arizona, approximately 7,000 inhabitants, is experiencing a wave of tourism since 2010, the year Instagram was launched. You may have heard of the Horseshoe Bend, where you can contemplate the famous view of the emerald Colorado river as it makes a U-turn. In 2010, only a few thousands came each year to appreciate the view offered near the U.S. Route 89. Nowadays, almost 2 million tourist hike the 1.5-mile from the parking. The number of tourists coming to the Horseshoe Bend used to peak during summer, now the stream of tourist is all year, around 5,000 people come every day. This comes with a dark side. People have died to take the perfect picture, a greek tourist died in 2010, a Phoenix man fell to his death when he slipped off the cliff edge in 2018, a 14-years-old girl died the same year after a fall of more than 200 meters. There is also environmental consequences, the number of tourists increasing, the infrastructures to welcome them have to increase too. In 2018, the city of Page and the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area ordered the construction, not only of a car park, but also of a viewing platform with a safety rail. This infrastructure has deteriorate the original aim of a national park which is “to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations” according to the National Park Service Organic Act signed in August 25, 1916.
